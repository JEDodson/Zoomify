Takes two arguments: requested hour:minute (24-hour format, 0:30, 01:15, 02:00, 03:15, 04:35 etc) and requested classroom URL (e.g. https://zoom.us/j/123456789
Checks every hour if the requested hour matches the current hour and minutes, and joins the user's class with commands dependent on their system if so.
